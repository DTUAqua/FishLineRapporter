Examples of how the @parametor selection in Fishline can be costom setup with sql querys

For a lecetion of; Years -> Species -> Cruise -> Area

Year = string

### Species
SELECT 	slr.speciesCode + ' - ' + ISNULL(s.dkName, ''),slr.speciesCode
FROM 	FishLineDW.dbo.age slr
		LEFT OUTER JOIN FishLineDW.dbo.L_Species s ON s.speciesCode = slr.speciesCode
WHERE year BETWEEN @paramYear1 and @paramYear2 and
(slr.individNum != 0)
GROUP BY  s.dkName, slr.speciesCode
ORDER BY slr.speciesCode

### Cruise
SELECT DISTINCT A.cruise, A.cruise
FROM FishLineDW.dbo.age A
WHERE A.year BETWEEN @paramYear1 AND @paramYear2 AND
	  A.speciesCode IN (@paramSpecies) AND
	  (A.individNum != 0)
    
### Area
SELECT t.dfuArea, t.dfuArea
FROM FishLineDW.dbo.age t
WHERE t.year BETWEEN @paramYear1 AND @paramYear2 AND
	  t.speciesCode IN (@paramSpecies) AND
	  t.cruise IN (@paramCruise) AND
	  (t.individNum != 0) 
GROUP BY t.dfuArea, t.dfuArea
ORDER BY t.dfuArea
